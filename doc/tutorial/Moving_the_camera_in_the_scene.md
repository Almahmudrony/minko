There are two camera modes in Minko : `Arc Ball` camera, to move the camera around a target, and `First Person` camera, to move the camera freely in the scene.

Arc Ball Camera
===============

In this mode, the camera will look at a target point and rotate around it.

Moving around a point
---------------------

When moving the mouse while holding left click, you will move the pitch and the yaw of the camera around the target point.

Changing the distance to the target
-----------------------------------

With the mouse wheel, you can zoom in and out on the target point.

Focusing a node
---------------

Type `F` to focus the currently selected node. The camera target will move to the origin of this node and the distance will adapt to show the node in its entirety.

Moving the camera and target point
----------------------------------

### Moving the camera on the local XZ plan

If you move the mouse while holding the `middle button`, the camera and target point will move along the camera XZ plan.

### Moving the camera on the local XY plan

If you move the mouse while holding the `right button`, the camera and target point will move along the camera XY plan.

### Moving the camera on the global Y axis

If you use the `mouse wheel` while holding `space`, you will move the camera up and down on the Y axis.

### Moving the camera on the global XZ plan

With the keyboard arrows, you can move the camera on the global XZ plan.

Speed modifiers
---------------

For every movement, holding the following keys will alter the speed :

-   `Shift` will multiply the speed for faster movements.
-   `Ctrl` will divide the speed for precise movements.
-   `Ctrl + Shift` will divide even more the speed for very precise movements

First Person Camera
===================

In this mode the camera can be moved freely on the scene.

Moving the camera direction
---------------------------

If you move the mouse while holding the `left button`, you will move the direction the camera is looking to, without moving the camera position.

Focusing a node
---------------

Type `F` to focus the currently selected node. The camera will move to show the node in its entirety.
