Step 1: Install Adobe AIR
=========================

In order to install Minko, you first have to get Adobe Air. If Air is already installed, be sure that you have at least Air 3.9. If not, make sure you update to the latest version before using Minko.

[Download Adobe Air](http://get.adobe.com/air/)

Step 2: Install Minko
=====================

Once you have installed Adobe Air, get the lastest version of Minko [here](http://minko.io/engine/#download). Launch the installer and once it has finished, you are ready to use Minko !

Note for Avast users
--------------------

`CrystalAtf.exe`, one of the executables used by Minko, is sometimes reported by Avast as being `Win32 Evo:Gen`. It is a false positive [to see here](https://www.google.fr/search?q=Win32+Evo%3AGen&rlz=1C1CHFX_frFR518FR518&oq=Win32+Evo%3AGen&aqs=chrome>..69i57.3411j0j1&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8#q=Win32+Evo%3AGen+false+positive) like many exist for this particular menace]. Avast will want to put the file in quarantine, which would cause texture importation/exportation problems.

If you have a paid version of Avast, you can add the file to the exclusions (see the barred phrase above). If you don't, we recommend you to uninstall Avast and use another antivirus such as [Microsoft Security Essentials](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download) which is lighter, efficient, free and non intrusive.
