In this tutorial, we will introduce how to work with the `BasicMaterial` to achieve simple color or texture based rendering. This tutorial will also introduce the relation between a `Material` and an `Effect` and how they are expected to work together during rendering.

Step 1: Creating the material
-----------------------------

To create a new `BasicMaterial` object, we simply create the `BasicMaterial::create()` static method:

```cpp
auto material = material::BasicMaterial::create();
```


Don't forget to use the `material::` prefix since the `BasicMaterial` class is defined in the `minko::material` namespace (and assuming you are already using the `minko` namespace).

It is important to understand the difference between a `Material` - such as the `BasicMaterial` - and an `Effect` - such as the `Basic.effect`:

-   an `Effect` is a (set of) rendering function(s)/program(s) - also known as shaders - that will compute the final color of a pixel on the screen,
-   a `Material` is a set of key/value pairs that provide the input data for the `Effect` to work on.

If an `Effect` was a function, then the values provided by a `Material` would be its arguments. It also means that materials and effects are loosely coupled: despite the fact that a `BasicMaterial` is expected to work with a `Basic.effect`, you can use one without the other. For example, you could:

-   use the `BasicMaterial` with the `Phong.effect`, but you won't have code-hinting on Phong related material properties in your IDE;
-   or use a `PhongMaterial` with a `Basic.effect`, but then a lot of material properties would actually be available in the code but unused during rendering.

To put it in a nutshell, you can use any `Material` with any `Effect` as long as the first provides all the property values expected by the second.

Step 2: Setting a diffuse color
-------------------------------

The `BasicMaterial` is expected to work along with the `Basic.effect`. As such, it provides getters and setters according to the binding property expected by this effect. One of this properties is the diffuse color.

The diffuse color is a solid RGBA color that will be used as the final pixel color. It can be set using three different methods that will all have the exact same behavior:

-   `BasicMaterial::diffuseColor(math::vec4 color)`, where `color` is an RGBA Vector4 value
-   `BasicMaterial::diffuseColor(uint rgba)`, where `rgba` is an RGBA formatted unsigned integer value
-   `BasicMaterial::set({{ "diffuseColor", math::vec4 color }})`, where `color` is an RGBA Vector4 value

It is important to understand that the first two methods are just syntaxic sugar on top of the `BasicMaterial::set()` method. This method itself is inherited from the `[data::Provider`](data::Provider`) class. In the end, any material is just a "dynamic" `[data::Provider`](data::Provider`) that declares user-friendly inlined getter/setters for the properties expected by the corresponding effect.

Therefore, this code:

```cpp
material->diffuseColor(Vector4::create(1.f, 0.f, 0.f, 1.f));
```


is strictly equivalent to:

```cpp
material->set({{"diffuseColor", vec4(1.f, 0.f, 0.f, 1.f)}});
```


This approach is very useful because it mixes the flexibility of dynamic properties referenced by simple string values and the user-friendliness of code-hinting for statically declared methods. According to what you're trying to do, you can chose the method that best fits your needs.

Performance wise, the static getters/setters declared in a material are (should be) inlined so it should make no difference.

To learn more on this subject, please read the [The difference between the Material_set() method and setter methods](../article/The_difference_between_the_Material_set%28%29_method_and_setter_methods.md]) article.

Step 3: Setting a diffuse map (or texture)
------------------------------------------

The `BasicMaterial` can also sample an RGBA texture as the final color of the pixel. To do this, we just have to set the `diffuseMap` property using the `BasicMaterial::diffuseMap()` setter:

```cpp
material->diffuseMap(texture);
```


or the `BasicMaterial::set()` dynamic method directly:

```cpp
material->set({{"diffuseMap", texture}});
```


If you set the `diffuseMap`, the `diffuseColor` property will not be used anymore. This is done thanks to Minko's support for "Ã¼ber-shaders". This feature allows the rendering engine to use rendering programs - or shaders - that can handle many different situations such as in this case rendering with a texture or a solid color. This is a very efficient solution to make it easy to customize rendering with little effort.

You can read more about textures in the [Loading and using textures](../tutorial/15-Loading_and_using_textures.md) tutorial.
