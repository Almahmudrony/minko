Unlike [point lights](../tutorial/27-Working_with_point_lights.md), which occupy a specific location in the 3D scene, a directional light doesn't have a position, ONLY a direction. Rays of from directional lights run parallel in a single direction from every point in the sky, and are typically used to simulate direct light.

Because a directional light represents a distant light source, its x,y,z coordinate means nothingâ€”only its rotational attribute has any bearing on how the scene will be illuminated.

As you can see in this more complex example, the directional light comes from a direction, not a specific location. it's particularly visible on the column shadow.

Step 1: Instantiate a directional light
---------------------------------------

The first very first thing you need to do is to include the following header to your .cpp file.

```cpp
#include <DirectionalLight.hpp> 
```


To create a new [DirectionalLight](http://doc.v3.minko.io/reference/classminko_1_1component_1_1_directional_light.html) object, we simply use the `DirectionalLight::create` static method.

Step 2: Adding a directional light to the scene
-----------------------------------------------

To add a point light to a scene, you have to understand that a `Scene` is a graph composed of one or more `Node`. Those nodes can contain elements that are called `Component`.

As `DirectionalLight` is a `Component` you'll have to follow this logic to create and add a light to a scene.

```cpp


 // Creating the Node
 auto directionalLightNode = scene::Node::create("directionalLight");
       
 // Adding the Component DirectionalLight
 directionalLightNode->addComponent(DirectionalLight::create());

  // Adding the Node to the root of the scene graph
 root->addChild(directionalLightNode);

```


As you can see in the code above, we first create a node named "directionalLight" to which we add an instance of a directional light. Of course you can chain those methods to perform all in one line of code

```cpp


 // Creating the Node & adding the Component DirectionalLight
 auto directionalLightNode = scene::Node::create("directionalLight")->addComponent(DirectionalLight::create());

```


Step 3: Change directional light properties
-------------------------------------------

you can directly change way the light appears by modifying it's public parameters, for example : 
```cpp


 auto directionalLight = DirectionalLight::create();
 directionalLight->diffuse(.4f);
 directionalLight->color()->setTo(0,0,0);

```


Step 4: Adjust a directional light
----------------------------------

Once the light is created you might want to give a direction to your directional light. To do this you need to add a transformation matrix to the Node holding your light.

```cpp
auto directionalLightNode= scene::Node::create("directionalLight")

       ->addComponent(DirectionalLight::create())
       ->addComponent(Transform::create(Matrix4x4::create()->lookAt(Vector3::zero(), Vector3::create(15.f, 20.f, 0.f))));

```


Step 5: Remove a directional light from the scene
-------------------------------------------------

You may sometime need to remove a light from a scene, to do this you simply need to remove the directional light from the `Node` it has been added to before.

```cpp


 // Adding an directional light
 auto directionalLightNode = scene::Node::create("directionalLight")->addComponent(DirectionalLight::create());

 // retrieving the component 
 auto directionalLight = directionalLightNode->component<DirectionalLight>(0);

 // Remove the component from the node
 directionalLightNode->removeComponent(directionalLight);

```


As you can see above, the first step is to retrieve the light component with previously created and then remove it from the `Node`
