Step 0: Bootstrap the application project
-----------------------------------------

The very first step is to follow the [Create a new application](../tutorial/Create_a_new_application.md) tutorial to bootstrap your appliation project/solution.

Step 1: Initialize the window
-----------------------------

We will use the SDL plugin to initialize a window. The following code is a simple C++ main function that initialize such window:

```cpp
#include "minko/Minko.hpp"
#include "minko/MinkoSDL.hpp"

using namespace minko;
using namespace minko::math;
using namespace minko::component;

const uint WINDOW_WIDTH = 800;
const uint WINDOW_HEIGHT = 600;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {

 auto canvas = Canvas::create("Hello cube!", WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT);

 canvas->run();

 return 0;

}
```


The call to `canvas->run()` will make the application loop until `canvas->quit()` is called or the window is closed.

Step 2: Load the assets
-----------------------

Before we can display anything, we need to load an `Effect`. An `Effect` is an external asset - a program actually - that will drive the rendering engine and tell it how things should be rendered. Everything you see on the screen, every final color of a pixel, has been rendered according to an `Effect`.

For now, we will just see how to load the `Basic.effect`, which is a very simple rendering program delivered by default with Minko's core framework. To use this `Effect` we first have to load it.

All the assets are loaded to and from an `AssetLibrary`. You can create an `AssetLibrary` yourself but it is a better practice to use the one provided with the `SceneManager` component. Indeed, this component will be added to the root `Node` of our scene, making all of the assets of its `SceneManager::assets()` property available to all descendants. As we will see later in this tutorial, the `SceneManager` is also responsible for stepping through frames rendering.

The following piece of code will create a `SceneManager` and use it's `SceneManager::assets()` property to load the `Basic.effect` from the filesystem:

```cpp
auto sceneManager = component::SceneManager::create(canvas);

sceneManager->assets()->loader()->queue("effect/Basic.effect"); auto complete = sceneManager->assets()->loader()->complete()->connect([&](file::Loader::Ptr loader) {

 // assets are loaded and ready

});

sceneManager->assets()->loader()->load();
```


The `AssetLibrary::queue()` method will enlist all the file names that you want to load: you can call `AssetLibrary::queue()` as many times as you have different files to load. Loading will eventually start when `AssetLibrary::load()` will be called. Then, the `AssetLibrary::complete()` signal will be called when all the required files have been a) successfully loaded or b) caused an error.

The `Basic.effect` file itself is not in your application: it's in Minko's core framework. Minko's build system is made in such a way that this kind of required files are copied automatically using post-build commands. Thus, you don't have to worry about the actual location of the `Basic.effect` file for now.

If you want to learn more about effects loading, you can read the [Loading effects](../tutorial/16-Loading_effects.md) tutorial.

Step 3: Initialize the scene
----------------------------

### Create the scene root node

The scene root is just a `Node` with the `SceneManager` component:

```cpp
auto root = scene::Node::create("root")

 ->addComponent(sceneManager);

```


### Add a camera

Our camera will be just a scene `Node` with two components:

-   a `Renderer`, that will take care of actual rendering operations
-   a `PerspectiveCamera` that will provide camera related data (world to view matrix, projection matrix...) for proper rendering

```cpp
auto camera = scene::Node::create("camera")

 ->addComponent(Renderer::create(0x7f7f7fff))
 ->addComponent(PerspectiveCamera::create(
   (float)WINDOW_WIDTH / (float)WINDOW_HEIGHT, (float)M_PI * 0.25f, .1f, 1000.f)
 );

root->addChild(camera);
```


Note how we initialize the `Renderer` with a custom background color with an RGBA formatted literal integer value.

The `PerspectiveCamera::create()` expects the following arguments:

-   `float aspectRatio`, the projection aspect ratio (width / height)
-   `float fieldOfView`, the angle around the y axis in radians
-   `float zNear`, the distance of the near clipping plane
-   `float zFar`, the distance of the far clipping plane

Step 4: Create the cube
-----------------------

### Create the cube scene node

To create the cube, we mainly have to:

-   create a scene `Node`
-   create a new `BasicMaterial`
-   create a new `CubeGeometry`
-   retrieve the loaded effect from the `AssetLibrary`

The following code will do those 4 steps:

```cpp
auto cube = scene::Node::create("cube");
auto cubeMaterial = material::BasicMaterial::create();
auto cubeGeometry = geometry::CubeGeometry::create(sceneManager->assets()->context());
auto cubeEffect = sceneManager->assets()->effect("effect/Basic.effect");

cube->addComponent(Surface::create(cubeGeometry, cubeMaterial, cubeEffect);
```


### Set the cube color

The `Basic.effect` expects the `diffuseColor` material value to be set to an RGBA `Vector4`. The following code will set the color of our cube to blue (R: 0, G: 0, B: 1, A: 1):

```cpp
cubeMaterial->diffuseColor(vec4(0.f, 0.f, 1.f, 1.f));
```


You can learn more about the `BasicMaterial` in the [Working with the BasicMaterial](../tutorial/10-Working_with_the_BasicMaterial.md) tutorial.

### Move the cube

By default, our `PerspectiveCamera` will be in (0, 0, 0) looking down the -Z axis. To make sure our cube is visible, we must translate it down the the -Z axis to make sure our camera is not inside the cube. To do this, we simply add a `Transform` component to our cube scene node:

```cpp
cube->addComponent(Transform::create(translate(vec3(0.f, 0.f, -5.f))));
```


Note that we initialize the `Transform` with a translation matrix holding a `vec3(0.f, 0.f, -5.f)`. You can learn more about the `Transform` component in the [Moving objects](../tutorial/04-Moving_objects.md) tutorial.

### Add the cube to the scene

We can then add our cube directly to the scene root using the `Node::addChild()` method:

```cpp
root->addChild(cube);
```


Step 5: Render the scene
------------------------

To render our scene, we will use the `SceneManager::nextFrame()` method. This method will tell all `Renderer` components to process their respective list of draw calls. Calling `SceneManager::nextFrame()` will process and render a single frame. To render frames whenever our window is ready, we will listen to the `canvas->enterFrame()` signal:

```cpp
auto enterFrame = canvas->enterFrame()->connect([&](Canvas::Ptr canvas, float t, float dt) {

 sceneManager->nextFrame(t, dt);

});
```


Step 6: Make the cube rotate
----------------------------

To rotate our cube, we just have to access its `Transform` component and apply the rotation we want. Here, we will use `math::rotate()` because we want our rotation to be done "before" the translation applied in step 4:

```cpp


auto transform = cube->component<Transform>();
transform->matrix(transform->matrix() * rotate(.01f, vec3(0.f, 1.f, 0.f)));

```


To make our cube rotate a bit more at each frame, we simply add this line to our "enter frame" callback:

```cpp
auto enterFrame = canvas->enterFrame()->connect([&](Canvas::Ptr canvas, float t, float dt) {

	auto transform = cube->component<Transform>();
	transform->matrix(transform->matrix() * rotate(.01f, vec3(0.f, 1.f, 0.f)));
	sceneManager->nextFrame(t, dt);

});
```
