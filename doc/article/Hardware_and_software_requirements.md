Minko is highly dependent on Stage3D and thus has the same requirements, and the same exceptions. You can check if your GPU can run Stage3D [on this page](http://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/multi/stage3d-unsupported-chipsets-drivers-flash.html). While this system requirements will allow you to run Minko, you must know that the limitation will mostly come from the size of the 3D scenes and the textures you work with.
