-   Lightweight **extensible MVC architecture**
-   Examples, tutorials and developers reference
-   Scripting through re-usable script components
-   Efficient and **extensible scene graph management** with a simple **unified asynchronous assets loading API**, signals and frustum culling
-   Single and multi-pass **post-processing**
-   Materials and effects
    -   Data-driven rendering engine through JSON declarative effect files
    -   Customizable GLSL **vertex and fragment shaders**
    -   Flat and cube textures with trilinear filtering
    -   Dynamic materials, material properties, effects and shaders
    -   Shader parts/Ã¼ber shaders
    -   Multi-pass rendering, render to texture, texture animations
    -   **Transparency** with customizable blending modes, painter's algorithm for proper alpha sorting and alpha maps
-   Lighting
    -   Single pass and multi-pass forward rendering with **per-pixel dynamic lighting**
    -   **Point, directional, spot and ambient lights**
    -   **Static and dynamic shadows** with Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF), Variance Shadow Mapping and Exponential Shadow Mapping
    -   Ambient, diffuse and specular lighting with support for specular maps
    -   **Normal mapping, parallax mapping and environment mapping** with Blinn Newell, probe and cube maps
-   Raycasting accelerated **pixel-perfect mouse interactivity**
